## üìù Project Overview

This project aims to create an accurate and efficient system for identifying citrus genera from images. Traditional methods for citrus identification are often slow, labor-intensive, and prone to human error. By leveraging state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models like MobileNet and Inception V3, this research provides a scalable and automated solution, which is crucial for improving agricultural productivity and quality control.

## üí° Motivation

Citrus fruits are a significant part of the global agricultural landscape, valued for their nutritional benefits and economic importance. Accurate classification is essential for market value optimization, quality control, and consumer satisfaction. The inefficiency of traditional, manual classification methods poses a major challenge to the citrus industry. This research is driven by the need for an automated, reliable system that can enhance efficiency, ensure consistency, and support the growing demand for traceable and sustainable agricultural products.

## üñºÔ∏è Dataset

The study utilized a comprehensive dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fahimyusuf/citrus/data), consisting of **22,348 images** of eight different citrus genera.

The eight genera included are:

- Limon Criollo
- Limon Mandarino
- Mandarina Pieldesapo
- Mandarina Israeli
- Naranja Valencia
- Tangelo
- Toronja
  The dataset was carefully curated and split into training, validation, and testing sets for rigorous model evaluation.
  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

The project follows a systematic workflow from data collection to model deployment, as shown in the diagram below.

_A placeholder for Figure 3.1 from the report_

1.  **Data Collection**: A dataset of 22,348 images was collected from Kaggle.
2.  **Data Preprocessing**: Images underwent rigorous preprocessing, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation (rotation, flipping, scaling) to enhance model performance and generalization.
3.  **Feature Extraction**: The pre-trained convolutional layers of the CNN models were used as powerful feature extractors, leveraging knowledge from massive image datasets to identify discriminative features in the citrus images.
4.  **Model Training**: Two deep learning models were fine-tuned for the citrus classification task:
    - **MobileNet**: A lightweight and efficient CNN architecture designed for mobile and embedded vision applications.
    - **Inception V3**: A deep CNN architecture known for high performance, built on the Inception module.
5.  **Model Evaluation**: The models were evaluated using standard metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## üìä Results

The performance of the models was evaluated to identify the most suitable architecture for citrus genus identification. **MobileNet** was found to be the best-performing model.

| Model         |  Accuracy  | Precision  |   Recall   | F1-Score |
| :------------ | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :------: |
| **MobileNet** | **99.85%** | **99.66%** | **99.52%** | **0.99** |
| Inception V3  | **98.90%** | **96.88**  | **99.32**  | **0.97** |

_[Source: Experimental results demonstrated that MobileNet outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy is 99.85%, precision is 99.66%, recall is 99.52% and Fl-score is 0.99.]_
